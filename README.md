# BrainFuck Compiler Challenge

[Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban Müller, and is notable for its extreme minimalism. It supports only a few instructions, and is practically unreadable.

This repo is a fork to prcatice implementing BF compilers, using the existing
code base as a test framework.
